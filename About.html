                    We are a company consisting of two people.
                    Even though we work as two, we do a quick and good job!
                    We have been working together for 5 years.

                <p>Shrek is a gigantic, green-skinned, physically intimidating ogre with a Scottish accent.
                    In Shrek Forever After, however, it is revealed that he is much smaller than the average ogre.
                    Even though his background is something of a mystery, according to Shrek The Musical,
                    it is revealed that on his seventh birthday, Shrek was sent away by his parents because it was an
                    ogre tradition.
                    He is seen traveling alone, being either screamed at or teased by passers-by. The only time he
                    receives a pleasant greeting is a wave from a young Fiona,
                    who is promptly led away by her parents. In the book, his parents threw him into a dark hole that
                    leads to the real world.</p>
